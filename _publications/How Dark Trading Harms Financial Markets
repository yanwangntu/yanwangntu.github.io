title: "How dark trading harms financial markets"
summary: "This paper estimates the impact of firm-level investments in automation technologies on worker-level outcomes. It finds that automation increases the probability of incumbent workers separating from their employers, in line with recent task-based models of automation. It shows that incumbent workers experience a 5-year cumulative wage income loss of 9 percent of one year's earnings on average, driven by decreases in days worked. These adverse impacts of automation are larger in smaller firms, and for older and less-educated workers. By contrast, no such losses are found for firms' investments in computers."

##### Abstract

We design an experiment to analyze the consequences of dark trading in
a financial market. The channel through which dark trading affects market
efficiency depends critically on how information regarding fundamentals is distributed
among investors. When information is concentrated in the hands of a
few investors, possibly due to sparse investor connectedness or low media coverage,
dark trading primarily impacts market efficiency by deteriorating the quality
of asset prices. When information is diffused, dark trading no longer harms price
discovery, but the unobserved liquidity entails welfare loss. Dark trading does
not widen the earnings gap between informed and uninformed traders.
