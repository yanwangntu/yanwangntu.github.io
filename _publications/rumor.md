## Abstract

We design an experiment featuring strategic information transmission from
a privately informed investor capable of swaying followers’ investment decisions
through a cheap-talk message. Confirming recent theoretical predictions, we
find that a short investment horizon of influencers encourages credible information
sharing among investors. Followers trade in the direction of the message
from a short-term influencer but ignore a long-term influencer’s communication.
Consequently, short-term influencers generate price impact through their
messages, which increases with the transparency of the trading institution,
while long-term influencers cannot affect the market price. The informational
efficiency of asset prices is invariant to the influencer’s investment horizon.
